## CRENBOX
https://cernbox.cern.ch/
The files will be put in the path like `/eos/user/u/username/`

## Web Service (via) EOS
See this [tutorial](https://cernbox-manual.web.cern.ch/cernbox-manual/en/web/personal_website_content.html)
A website can be put in `/eos/user/u/username/www` after following it, but a tool (like [Hexo](https://hexo.io)) is still needed to generate the website.
